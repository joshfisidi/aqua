## "Be Like Water"

# Aqua Language
## Aqua is a modular programming language designed to simplify software development by allowing developers to connect reusable components, called cups, in a clean, intuitive syntax. With Aqua, you can easily combine JavaScript, Python, and Rust code without needing to worry about the underlying complexities.

## Overview
Aqua enables developers to build applications quickly by using a Lego-like approach to coding. Each cup functions as a building block, allowing users to assemble sophisticated software in a few hours to days. The language emphasizes readability and ease of use, making it accessible for beginners and experienced developers alike.

# Key Features
Modular Architecture: Build applications by connecting reusable cups.
Natural Language Syntax: Use a clean and intuitive syntax without traditional programming symbols.
Cross-Language Compatibility: Easily connect JavaScript, Python, and Rust components.
Speed of Development: Quickly assemble complex applications with minimal coding.

## Snippet Preview
Hereâ€™s a simple example of Aqua code that retrieves a number from localStorage and updates a display on the webpage:
```
start
    key = storedNumber
    currentNumber = GetNumberFromStorage key
    UpdateText numberDisplay Current Number currentNumber
    newNumber = 42
    SaveNumberToStorage key newNumber
    UpdateText numberDisplay New Number newNumber
connect
```

# Cup Definitions
## SaveNumberToStorage Cup

```
cup SaveNumberToStorage
    input key string number number
    output none
    language javascript
    code
        localStorage setItem key number
    endcode
connect
```
# GetNumberFromStorage Cup

```
cup GetNumberFromStorage
    input key string
    output number number
    language javascript
    code
        storedNumber = localStorage getItem key
        if storedNumber
            return parseFloat storedNumber
        else
            return 0
    endcode
connect
```
# Getting Started
## To get started with Aqua, clone the repository and explore the examples. You can also create your own cups and start building applications that integrate seamlessly across languages.

```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aqua.git```
```cd aqua```
