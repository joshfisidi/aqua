# Aqua Language
## Aqua is a modular programming language designed to simplify software development by allowing developers to connect reusable components, called cups, in a clean, intuitive syntax. With Aqua, you can easily combine JavaScript, Python, and Rust code without needing to worry about the underlying complexities.

## Overview
Aqua enables developers to build applications quickly by using a Lego-like approach to coding. Each cup functions as a building block, allowing users to assemble sophisticated software in a few hours to days. The language emphasizes readability and ease of use, making it accessible for beginners and experienced developers alike.

# Key Features
Modular Architecture: Build applications by connecting reusable cups.
Natural Language Syntax: Use a clean and intuitive syntax without traditional programming symbols.
Cross-Language Compatibility: Easily connect JavaScript, Python, and Rust components.
Speed of Development: Quickly assemble complex applications with minimal coding.
